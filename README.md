## **Introduction**

This project is a web app made to bridge the gap between those with excess food to give and those who need food.

## Available scripts

After cloning the project, run `npm start` inside the `frontend` and `backend` directories to start the `React` and `NodeJS` servers respectively.

The React server runs on `locahost:3000` and the NodeJS server runs on `locahost:5000`

Enjoy!
